# Project_Anya
Project inspired by the Martin Kleppmann's book: Designing Data-Intensive Applications

Trying to incorporate the ideas explained in this book in code. Designing scenarios, finding an appropriate Data Modeling strategy and execution.
Performance Evaluation and comparison of how different techniques affect the performance of the system

In this project I will only be looking at Database systems, and database techniques.
